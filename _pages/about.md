# About Me

I'm Anne Musau, a tech-savvy and detail-oriented professional with a background in data analysis, digital systems, and customer-focused problem solving. Currently transitioning into Quality Assurance, I bring a strong foundation in testing principles, analytical thinking, and automation tools — all built on my experience in **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **web development**.

My interest in QA stems from a passion for building reliable, user-friendly solutions and ensuring that products meet the highest standards of performance, security, and usability. I have hands-on experience working with data-intensive systems, and I understand the importance of catching issues early, validating requirements, and maintaining clear documentation throughout the software development lifecycle.

Driven by curiosity, I’m excited to grow my skills in manual and automated testing while contributing to teams that value quality, collaboration, and innovation. I'm committed to **lifelong learning** and value roles that challenge me to think critically, collaborate effectively, and contribute to products that make a measurable difference.
